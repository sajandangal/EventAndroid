Online event scheduling system is a software project that serves the functionality of an event manager. The system allows only registered users to login and new users can resister on the application. The project provides most of the basic functionality required for an event. It allows the user to select from a list of event types. 
# Features
•	User registration 
•	User login 
•	Users can post events 
•	Users can view all the events 
•	Selected user gets the events as involved

# Aim

To develop and design a simple REST API used to where users can add and view events.

# Objectives

•	A simple and user friendly experience should be created. 
•	Test the android-application being designed in order to increase the efficiency and performance of android-application. 
•	Each steps during the development phase must be tracked.
•	Create a secure authentication protocol for registration and login
•	Database of the system should be well design so that system can run smoothly.

# REST CLIENT

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. REST is any interface between systems using HTTP to obtain data and generate operations on those data in all possible formats, such as XML and JSON. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used. We use REST client because REST is the most logical, efficient and widespread standard in the creation of APIs for Internet services.
Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based web service. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON we use GSon, but we can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.

# Conclusion

Hence with learning about new concept and new technology, a simple restful API is developed to carry out a simple task.
